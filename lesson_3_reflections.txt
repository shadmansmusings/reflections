SO - lesson_3_reflections.txt pulled down
NOTE - I had created the file, but pull failed because the file existed and git
didn't want to overwrite it. I deleted the file, redid the pull - and all was
good.

So the sequence is:
#changes, save.
# to see what changed:
git status

# to stage the changes:
git add <fname> [<fname>, etc]

# verify they are staged:
git status

# commit with message:
git commit -m "some message here"

# push changes to github:
git push origin master


When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When you want to backup your work so as not to lose anything. Also, once you
might be done with a working session / day / whatever. You never want to forget
where you are, or take the chance of losing or overwriting changes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Some sort of auto pull could possibly overwrite local changes. Manually pulling
lets you control the changes in your local repo.
