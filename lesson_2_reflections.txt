What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repo, you create an .git directory to contain all of the
metadata needed to keep track of the changes made to the files and the versions
they are associated with. You need to do the init to create an empty git repo
to be able to commit changes to it.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

You things into the staging area before a commit. The working directory contains
the files for the project.
